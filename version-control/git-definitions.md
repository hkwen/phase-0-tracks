# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?: Version control is a way to keep a history of all different versions of a file. It is useful when you want to go back to an old version and see what changes you made over time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?: A branch is a location in the development process that allows you to create new features and make new changes. This is useful in order to write code that is independent of the master branch and will not affect the master branch until the branches merge.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?: A commit takes a record of the change made in your local repository. A good commit message is a clear summary of the changes you made so if you ever come back to see the history of your changes, your commit message reminds you and other programmers of what exactly you did.

* What is a merge conflict?: A merge conflict is an issue that prevents branches from merging. It is caused when someone else edits or deletes the same file that you also modified--in which case, git doesn't know what command to listen to. Thus, you need to resolve the merge conflict in order to move on.
